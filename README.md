# nlp
Final project for natural language processing.
This repository documents how I use natural language processing and random forest machine learning to evaluate the evidence of latent linguistic differences between sex seller advertisements indicated to be likely to be associated with sex trafficking and those not likely to be associated with sex trafficking. NLP is done in Python markdown, and ML is done in R markdown. Data is not included due to its sensitive nature. Inquiries for data access should be directed to sarah.e.sowell@vanderbilt.edu.
